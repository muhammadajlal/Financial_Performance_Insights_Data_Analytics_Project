# Financial_Performance_Insights_Data_Analytics_Project

In this project, I made an insightful Power BI dashboard of a hypothetical company that could track its finnancial performance over the years. 

Key Steps involved in this Project:

- Problem Statement (Finding the points of pain responsible for the poor financial performance of this company in recent years).
- Data Discovery (Loading data into MySQL Server).
- Exploratory Data Analysis using MySQL Workbench. 
- Data Wrangling and ETL in Power BI using Power Query M.
- Dashboard Building in Power BI using DAX.
- Exporting pbix and PDF files of Dashboard.
